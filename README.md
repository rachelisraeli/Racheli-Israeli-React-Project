# React Appointment Management App for Professionals

This project is a React-based web application designed for professionals to manage their appointment calendar effectively. The app allows customers to schedule appointments with the professional, and it provides the professional with an organized and color-coded view of all scheduled appointments.

## Features

- **Customer Scheduling**: Customers can select from a variety of services provided by the professional and book appointments directly through the website.
- **Professional View**: The professional can view all appointments sorted by time and color-coded based on their timing for better visual management.
- **Service Options**: Multiple services are available for customers to choose from.
- **Modern Design**: Styled using MUI (Material-UI) for a professional and user-friendly interface.
- **State Management**: Global state is managed efficiently using MobX.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, MUI (Material-UI)
- **State Management**: MobX
- **Backend**: Node.js (server hosted in a separate project)

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that the backend server (Node.js) is running. This is necessary for the application to fetch and save appointment data.
2. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if not already installed.

   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Ensure the backend server is running by navigating to the server project and running:
